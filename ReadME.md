# Waze Churn Prediction Analysis Overview

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Waze Churn Prediction Analysis project. As a data analyst, I'm thrilled to share a sneak peek into what you can expect from this exploration into Waze's user data.

## **Background on Waze Scenario**
Waze, our favorite navigation app, is on a mission to enhance user retention and growth. This project dives into the exciting realm of predicting monthly user churn using a dataset named `waze_dataset.csv`. This dataset, crafted in partnership with Waze, provides a synthetic yet comprehensive view of user activities.

## **Key Project Questions & Considerations**
### **Audience**
Our primary audience includes the Waze data team and other cross-functional team members.

### **Objectives**
1. **Develop a Predictive Model:** We're aiming to build a machine learning model that predicts user churn.
2. **Data Exploration & Insights:** We'll unravel questions about the dataset, identify crucial variables, spot trends, and take steps to minimize bias.

### **Deliverables**
Expect a well-prepared package of deliverables:
- A cleaned dataset ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Engaging visualizations providing insightful discoveries.
- Implementation of a statistical model, regression analysis, and a robust machine learning model.

## **Guided Tour Through the Project Phases**
### **1. Data Dictionary Insights**
A quick tour through the dataset's key columns and types, setting the stage for what lies ahead.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
We'll take a deep dive into the dataset, uncovering patterns and peculiarities. Highlights include:
- Comparisons between retained and churned users.
- Snapshots of user profiles, including the potential prevalence of long-haul drivers.

### **3. Model Building Adventures**
#### **Logistic Regression Journey**
- We'll initiate our modeling journey with logistic regression, exploring its performance and uncovering key insights.

#### **XGBoost Expedition**
- A more sophisticated model using XGBoost. We'll engineer features, address outliers, and evaluate its prowess against logistic regression.

### **4. Feature Importance Expedition**
- A trek into the most influential features driving our predictions.

## **Closing Thoughts and Recommendations**
1. **Use with Caution:** While our models show promise, we'll advise on their cautious use, especially for impactful decisions.
2. **Room for Enhancement:** Recommendations for model improvement and gathering additional insightful features.

## **Further Details**
Dive into the accompanying notebook for a comprehensive journey, filled with code snippets, detailed analyses, and the nitty-gritty of our modeling escapades.

Enjoy the adventure! ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
